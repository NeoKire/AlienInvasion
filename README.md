## Alien Invasion Minecraft Mod (Forge/1.7.10)

The Alien Invasion mod creates a large scale invasion event in Minecraft. It adds new
resources, items, machinery, weapons and mobs to the game.

The mod also adds a loose progression path to the game. Once you have developed the right
kinds of tech and obtained the necessary information, you can travel to the aliens'
homeworld (and beyond), discovering entirely new world types and creatures.


### Building the JAR
1. Checkout the source using a Git client (or download the ZIP and extract it somewhere)
1. Run `gradlew setupCIWorkspace build` in the project root directory
1. Pick up your loot (the compiled and obfuscated JAR file) from the build/libs folder

### Disclaimer
The mod is in constant and rapid development. While I will aim to ensure that no code
gets committed until it is fully tested, bugs are bound to occur. If you find a bug
you can submit a GitHub issue and I'll do my best to fix it promptly.
